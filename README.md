# otp-provider
One-Time Passcode (OTP) Identity Provider is one of the low assurance BCGOV authentication service that verifies a user’s identity by generating and validating short-lived, single-use passcodes. Instead of relying on permanent passwords, the OTP Identity Provider issues a temporary code delivered via email, that the user must enter during login.
